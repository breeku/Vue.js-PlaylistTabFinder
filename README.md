# Vue.js-PlaylistTabFinder

## [Link](https://playlisttabfinder.now.sh/)

Search for tabs from your Spotify playlists. Currently scrapes tab url and tuning from songsterr and inserts them to database.

### Goals:
#### Both:
- [x] Analytics
- [ ] Search for tabs from Ultimate Guitar too (no api and they seem to limit requests)
- [ ] Get all tabs for current page
#### Frontend:
- [x] Prevent spam clicking
- [x] Search history
- [x] Smoother transitions (some still need work)
- [x] Filters (tuning, sort).
- [ ] Spotify play button
#### Backend:
- [ ] Fix track artist check (currently gets artist wrong if theres more than one).
